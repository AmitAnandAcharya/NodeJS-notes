# Node.js 
It's an open-source runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and provides a platform for server-side and networking applications. Node.js enables developers to use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side development, which promotes code reusability and simplifies the development process.

## Highlights

### Asynchronous
Asynchronous operations in Node.js let us do multiple things at the same time, without waiting for each task to finish, which makes our programs faster and more efficient.

### Non-blocking
Non-blocking refers to the ability of a system to continue executing other tasks while waiting for a particular task to complete. 

### Event-driven
It means that Node.js listens for events and executes specific code when those events occur, rather than following a sequential flow of execution.

### JavaScript on the server: 
Node.js lets developers use JavaScript on the server-side

### Vast ecosystem: 
Node.js has a rich ecosystem of modules and packages available through npm, facilitating easy integration of libraries, frameworks, and tools into projects.

### Fast and lightweight: 
Node.js is known for its speed and efficiency. It utilizes the V8 engine to compile JavaScript code directly into machine code, resulting in high-performance execution. It also has a small memory footprint, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Overall, Node.js is popular for building web servers, real-time applications, APIs, command-line tools, and more, thanks to its versatility, scalability, and ease of use.
